Like other text editors, Sublime Text uses a system called Syntax Highlighting which helps in coding by visually identifying different parts of code with color. This allows you to more easily read the code, helping both in drawing it up and spotting errors. In Sublime Text, the theme dictates what colors will be used for highlighting
## Installing
After downloading the Endless-Sky-Sublime-Syntax-main.zip file, extract the files from it. Inside, you will find only one file named "Endless Sky.sublime-syntax".
1. **Open** Sublime Text
2. Go to **Preferences** > **Browse Packages**
3. **Drag and drop** the file you downloaded, "Endless Sky.sublime-syntax", into that folder and close the window.
4. Go to **View** > **Syntax** and select **"Endless Sky"**. Your code should now automatically be highlighted.
## Preview
Here are a few examples of what the syntax highlighting might look like depending on the theme:
